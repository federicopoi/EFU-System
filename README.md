## General info
EFU System is a software which digitize Total Process Management (TPM) tags. EFU System is build with Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS.

Big Argentinian process industries such as COFCO, KLOCKNER and PLASTICOS BOULEVARES are using this software in order to reduce the time to manage tags and generate graphics in real time.

Other benefits of using this software in contrast to the old physical system are:

• A role based security system was implemented to create permission based roles.

• TPM Tags can be read by QR Code.

• For a better understanding of the problem, pictures can be attached.

• Dynamic tables can be generated and exported to excel.

• TPM tags can be edited and deleted by the ADMIN.
